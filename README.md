:trophy: Do you need an opponent for a friendly?

:couple: Do you want to find a team as a new player?

:mega: Do you desire to receive jolly tactical advice?

:smirk: Do you care to analyse vanity statistics?

**Futsal Friend** is a small web application built using player and competition data from [Liefhebbers Zaalvoetbal Cup](https://www.lzvcup.be/), a Belgian futsal organisation counting over 900 teams. Its usefulness is not limited to players from one of the LZV Cup leagues.
